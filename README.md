# Health Icons

Free, open source health icons available for any use. Use for your next commercial or personal project. You don’t need to give credit and you can edit the icons however you want. Health Icons is a volunteer effort to create a 'global good' for health projects all over the world. Website: [healthicons.org](https://healthicons.org)
<br />
<br />

## Using Health Icons

These icons are available in the public domain ([CC0](<[https://healthicons.org](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)>)) for use in any type of project. Icons are available in several formats:

- All icons are produced in "outline" and "filled" styles
- Each icon is available in SVG and in PNG (48px and 96px)
- Many icons are also available in a smaller 24px format

Icons can be downloaded:

- Individually from [our website](https://healthicons.org)
- Together as [a ZIP file](https://healthicons.org/icons.zip)
- Via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/healthicons): `npm i healthicons` or `yarn add healthicons`
  <br />

## How to contribute

We’d love for you to join our team of volunteer designers and developers!

1. Join our open Slack channel by emailing [contact@healthicons.org](mailto:contact@healthicons.org)
2. Browse the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mbsBVYXECIOl5E0kkGAiC2/?node-id=978%3A3) and contribute icons in the "New icons" section. Please read the code of conduct ([below](https://github.com/resolvetosavelives/healthicons#code-of-conduct)) and the styleguide (in the Figma) carefully before contributing.

<br />

## Installing and running the website locally

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

This is the intended way to contribute to the code base:

1. [Fork the main repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) so you have your own copy which will be at `https://github.com/{your-username}/healthicons/`
2. Check it your fork on your computer: `gh repo clone {your-username}}/healthicons`
3. Add a remote referencing the main repo: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:resolvetosavelives/healthicons.git`
4. Fetch the remote upstream using: `git fetch upstream`
5. Create a new branch based on the RTSL repo’s main branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name upstream/main`
6. Install dependencies using `yarn install`
7. Run the project locally using `yarn dev`
8. Make all of your changes and make a bunch of commits
9. Push to your branch: `git push origin my-branch-name`
10. On Github, create a pull request from your branch to `upstream/main`
11. After that, an admin of the project will review the pull request and then offer feedback and/or merge it

**Importing the latest icon information from Figma**

To pull the latest icon information from Figma, update the open-graph images, and update the sitemap.xml:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Go to your account settings on [figma.com](https://www.figma.com) and generate a new access token under "Personal access tokens" and copy it to your clipboard.
3. In `.env.local`, add `FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="{token-goes-here}"`
4. Run `yarn update-icons`
5. If you're committing to a branch on git, make sure to remember to add the newly generated files in the `/public/` directory.

<br />

## Publishing new icons to the website

1. Run the website locally (see above)
2. Delete all of the icons from your local directories `/public/icons/png/` and `/public/icons/svg/`
3. Go the `Export` page on Figma
4. Make sure all new icons are tagged (see below)
5. Export as PNG: Select all of the icons and export all as `1x PNG` and `2x PNG`
6. Export as SVG: Select all of the icons and export all as `SVG`
7. In your terminal, type: `yarn update-icons`
8. Test the website locally at `localhost:4000`
9. Commit your changes to a new branch on Github
10. Raise a PR and request a review from another volunteer via Slack
11. Wait for review
12. Merge the PR

<br />

## Tagging icons in Figma

**Icon 'Title' and 'Tags' in Figma**

Each icon should have a title and tags which are added in the “Description” field in Figma. The format is:
`{title} [{tag1}, {tag2}, {tag3}…, dhis2:{tag}]`

**Some examples:**

`donkey` icon:  
`Donkey [Animal, Ass, Farm, Mule, dhis2:donkey]`

`blood_rh_p` icon:  
`Blood Type RH+ [Blood, RH Positive, dhis2:blood_rh_p]`

**More details:**

- The “Description” only needs to go on the “filled” version of the icon in Figma
- Icon titles should be in [Title Case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case) with each word capitalized
- Tags are essentially synonyms or important related words that would help someone find the icon. They could also be alternative uses of the icon, the way a donkey could represent “farm”. If someone searches “blood” or “positive” they’ll see any icons that are tagged with those words. Tags should also be Title Case.
