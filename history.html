DHIS2 is a popular open source digital health tool that is used governments in over 70 countries all over the world. DHIS2 has many admirable qualities, but the quality of the icons in their software back in 2021 were very inconsistent. See below.</p><p><img src="/ui/dhis2-icons-old.png" alt="An example of the old icons in DHIS2" width="800" height="400" class="about_fullImage__JtAgp"/><caption class="about_caption__cHl3H">The original DHIS2 icons that were replaced by our Health Icons.</caption></p><p>DHIS2 had around 400 icons that represented common themes in public health, education, and climate change. Many were pretty commonsense icons that you might expect from health, like hospital, clinic, blood pressure monitor, etc. But some icons were very specific concepts like<!-- --> <a href="https://healthicons.org/icon/outline/diagnostics/rdt-result_invalid">Rapid Diagnostic Testing Result Invalid</a> <!-- -->that were related to specific usages of DHIS2 for managing pandemic response programs. Other examples include<!-- --> <a href="https://healthicons.org/icon/outline/diagnostics/cone-test_on_nets">Cone Test on Nets</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://healthicons.org/icon/outline/diagnostics/discriminating-concentration_bioassays">Discriminating Concentration Bioassays</a>. If you&#x27;re ever wondering why the collection includes some very specfic icon, the answer is probably because it was in the original DHIS2 collection.</p><p>The original DHIS2 collection was scaled at 48px size because they were often used as descriptive symbols in the DHIS2 software and needed quite a bit of detail. So, accordingly, our first 2 years of Health Icons followed this standard. We would later create 24px icons that are a better match with popular icon sets like Google&#x27;s Material icons, Remix icons, Feather icons, etc.</p><p>Many of the original icons that were created for DHIS2 feature the tag &quot;DHIS2&quot; and can be found by searching Health Icons by &quot;DHIS2&quot;.</p><p>Health Icons were first incorporated into<a href="https://dhis2.org/releases/version-237/">DHIS2 version 2.37</a> <!-- -->in June 2021.</p><h2>A volunteer effort in 2021</h2><p>Daniel put out a call on Twitter to see if other people wanted to help out with the effort to replace the DHIS2 icons. About a dozen designers jumped in and we started redesigning DHIS2 icons in Figma. At first we didn&#x27;t have a well-defined style guide for new icons and were just making up styles as we went. After a few weeks, we stopped and looked at what made a good &quot;Health Icon.&quot; We established a few standards, like:</p><ul><li>2 pixel stroke width</li><li>Intentional mixing of round endcaps for strokes and sharp endcaps</li><li>Cutouts in shapes to create uniqueness (e.g.<!-- --> <a href="/icon/filled/devices/microscope">Microscope</a>)</li></ul><h2>CC0 public domain</h2><p>Paragraph</p><h2>The website</h2><p>Text</p><h2>Other volunteer projects</h2><p>Figma plugin</p><p>React packages</p><h2>Icons vs. symbols</h2><p>Paragraph</p><h2>No tracking usage?</h2><p>Paragraph</p><h2>Health icons in the wild</h2><p>Paragraph</p></div></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/history","query":{},"buildId":"UP5DakqpDRbsbes9RToAz","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
